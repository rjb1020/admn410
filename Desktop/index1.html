			<h1> History </h1>
			Here at Durham House of Pets we have been providing quality supplies for your pets 
			since the founder Dom Grady opened the doors back in 1998. Dom opened DHP to help 
			sell affordable animal food to the students in Durham that attended the University 
			of New Hampshire. Once the word of DHP’s great quality and great prices for animal 
			food got out business was booming for Dom. Overtime Dom decided to expand from just 
			animal food to all sorts of supplies, accessories, toys, and just about anything you 
			could need for your pet.

			<h2> Why Use Us </h2>
			Durham House of Pets provides you with the best quality products for your pet at an 
			affordable cost. Dom Grady attended the University of New Hampshire, and during his 
			Junior year he decided to adopt a puppy. He quickly learned how expensive a pet can 
			be and from then he vowed to open a pet supply store with affordable prices to help 
			students. Dom has walked in the shoes of the students that live in Durham and own 
			pets, he knows how tough, financial it can be and he will stop at nothing to continue 
			to provide affordable products.
